---
ðŸ“Œ What is Emmet?

Emmet is a productivity tool built into VS Code that lets you write HTML and CSS faster using shortcuts called abbreviations. Instead of typing full tags and properties, you type a short expression, hit Tab (or the Emmet expand key), and Emmet expands it into full code.

ðŸš€ Why use Emmet?

Saves time: Write 10â€“20 lines of HTML in one abbreviation.
Reduces typos: Less manual typing â†’ fewer mistakes.
Improves workflow: Lets you focus on structure, not boilerplate.
Built-in: No extra extension needed in VS Code.

âš¡ How to use Emmet in VS Code

Open an HTML or CSS file.
Type an abbreviation (e.g. ul>li*3>a{Link $}).
Press Tab â†’ it expands into full code.
Make sure Settings â†’ Emmet: Trigger Expansion On Tab is enabled.
